## Path expansion

### Scheme
    paths:
      <path>:
        ...
        x-apigen-binding:
          model: string
          
### Definition
- `x-apigen-binding`: Section where the connection between the endpoint and the model we will use is defined
   - `model`: In this field, we can specify the name of the model.
 
### Sample
    paths:
      /colors:
        x-apigen-binding:
          model: Color
          
## Extension of the schema section of the requestBody

### Scheme

    schemas:
      <schema>:
        x-apigen-mapping:
          model: string
      type: object
      properties:
        <prop_name>:
          type: string
          x-apigen-mapping:
            model: string
            field: string
        <prop_name_2>:
          x-apigen-mapping:
            model: string

### Definition

- `x-apigen-mapping`: Section where all mapping data between resources and models are defined. Each attribute of an input resource, including the input resource itself, can have this section defined. If it is not defined, it is assumed to have the default values indicated in each section.
  - `model`: Name of the model that the resource or attribute represents. If not specified at the resource level, it is not considered a standard input resource.
  - `field`: Name of the model attribute to which the resource attribute will be mapped. By default, if nothing is specified, it will be mapped to an attribute with the same name if it exists; otherwise, it will be ignored. There are two specific cases in which it is mandatory to define this field:
    - When the name of the attribute in the resource and in the model are different:
      ```yaml
      nombre:
        type: string
        x-apigen-mapping:
          field: primerNombre
      ```
    - When the attribute in the resource is an abbreviation of the identifier of a nested model:
      ```yaml
      color:
        type: string
        x-apigen-mapping:
          model: color
          field: valorCromatico.id
      ```

## Expansion of the response outline section

### Preconditions

The Apigen extension for OpenAPI forces us to take into account a series of conditions so that endpoint responses comply with the standard.

#### Have a defined standard response

````yaml
  schemas:
    standard_response_result:
      properties:
        result:
          type: object
          properties:
            status:
              type: boolean
            http_code:
              type: integer
            errors:
              type: array
              items:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/standard_error'
            info:
              type: string
            trace_id:
              type: string
            num_elements:
              type: integer
          required:
            - status
            - http_code
            - trace_id
    standard_error:
      type: object
      properties:
        code:
          type: integer
        message:
          type: string
````

#### Have a single standard collection response defined for each model

````yaml
  schemas:
    standard_response_collection_<model>:
      allOf:
        - $ref: "#/components/schemas/standard_response_result"
        - type: object
          properties:
            data:
              type: object
              properties:
                <model_plural>:
                  type: array
                  items:
                    $ref: "#/components/schemas/<model_resource>"
````

#### Have a single simple standard response defined for each model

````yaml
  schemas:
    standard_response_<model>:
      allOf:
        - $ref: "#/components/schemas/standard_response_result"
        - type: object
          properties:
            data:
              $ref: "#/components/schemas/<model_resource>"
````

### Scheme

        <prop_name>:
          type: string
          x-apigen-mapping:
            field: string
            
### Definition
- `x-apigen-mapping`: Section where all mapping data between resources and models are defined. Each output resource must have this section defined.
  - `model`: Name of the model that the resource represents.
  - `field`: Name of the model attribute to which the resource attribute will be mapped.

### Sample
