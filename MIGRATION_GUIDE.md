# Migration guide

All changes required to migrate generated Apigen projects to new versions will be documented in this file.

## From [0.5.0] to [0.6.0]

This version requires to replace the hibernate uuid generation.

Old:
```java
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(
            generator = "uuid"
    )
    @GenericGenerator(
            name = "uuid",
            strategy = "uuid2"
    )
    @Column(
            name = "id"
    )
    private String id;
```

New:
```java
    @Id
    @UuidGenerator
    @Column(
            name = "id"
    )
    private String id;
```
## From [0.4.0] to [0.5.0]

No migration required

## From [0.3.0] to [0.4.0]

In this version Apigen has been updated to use Spring Boot 3, so now you need a java version >= `17`

Support for PATCH endpoints has been added and the PUT endpoint behaviour has changed. 
To maintain the same functionality as in the previous versions you need to use
`AbstractRelationsLegacyManager` and `AbstractCrudLegacyService` instead of `AbstractRelationsManager` and `AbstractCrudService`

## From [0.2.0] to [0.3.0]

No migration required

## From [0.1.0] to [0.2.0]

In this version Apigen has been updated to be auto documented with `spring-doc` and all the dependencies have been updated.

- Replace the autogenerated documentation annotations in controllers from `io.swagger.annotations.Api` to `io.swagger.v3.oas.annotations.tags.Tag`
- Perform the Spring Boot migration from `2.4.x` to `2.6.x`
- Remove the property `apigen.documentation.enabled`, now the documentation is managed by the `spring-doc` official properties
