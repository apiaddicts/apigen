# Migration guide

All changes required to migrate generated Apigen projects to new versions will be documented in this file.

## From [0.1.0] to [0.2.0]

In this version Apigen has been updated to be auto documented with `spring-doc` and all the dependencies have been updated.

- Replace the autogenerated documentation annotations in controllers from `io.swagger.annotations.Api` to `io.swagger.v3.oas.annotations.tags.Tag`
- Perform the Spring Boot migration from `2.4.x` to `2.6.x`
- Remove the property `apigen.documentation.enabled`, now the documentation is managed by the `spring-doc` official properties
